<div class="sec-head reveal"><span class="sec-label">Public Explanation</span><h2 class="sec-title">Carpinoy Business Package &mdash; Trusted Accredited Associates</h2>
<p class="sec-sub">Carpinoy Logistics Services formally introduces its Carpinoy Business Package Accredited Associates as part of its continuing advocacy to support individuals and entities who wish to participate in the logistics industry through an independent and business-oriented arrangement.</p></div>

<div class="legal-content">
<div class="reveal">
<h2>Nature of the Accredited Associate Program</h2>
<p>Carpinoy Business Package Accredited Associates are exclusive, trusted, and authorized partners who are allowed to facilitate the entry of transport units strictly within the scope of the Authorized Car Dealership to which they are officially assigned. Only these Accredited Associates are recognized to endorse and assist unit owners in processing their participation within the Carpinoy Logistics network.</p>
<div class="callout">It is hereby emphasized that no membership fee, joining fee, processing fee, or any similar charge is required to enter Carpinoy Logistics Services, provided that the onboarding is facilitated through Carpinoy Trusted Accredited Associates. Entry into Carpinoy is free of charge, and any form of unauthorized collection is not sanctioned by management.</div>
</div>

<div class="reveal">
<h2>No Employer-Employee Relationship</h2>
<p>For public clarity and legal transparency, Carpinoy Business Package Accredited Associates are NOT employees of Carpinoy Logistics Services. There exists no employer-employee relationship, whether express or implied, between Carpinoy Management and its Accredited Associates.</p>
<p>The Accredited Associate arrangement is not employment, not manpower supply, and not labor contracting or subcontracting as defined under Philippine labor laws. Associates operate independently, on their own discretion, methods, resources, and business judgment. They do not receive salaries, wages, employment benefits, or mandatory employer contributions from Carpinoy Logistics Services.</p>
<p>This program is extended purely as a business opportunity and a voluntary, non-compulsory free privilege granted to individuals who wish to explore entrepreneurship within the logistics ecosystem.</p>
</div>

<div class="reveal">
<h2>No Guarantee of Income, Profit, or Business Success</h2>
<p>Carpinoy Logistics Services does not provide any guarantee, assurance, or promise that participation in Carpinoy or engagement in logistics activities will result in income, profit, growth, or financial success.</p>
<p>As with any form of business, outcomes depend on proper management, discipline, market conditions, operational decisions, financial planning, and individual effort. Logistics, like all industries, carries inherent business risks, and success is not automatic nor assured.</p>
<p>Participants are therefore encouraged to conduct their own due diligence and to approach the opportunity with a clear understanding that Carpinoy does not offer guaranteed returns or representations of assured prosperity.</p>
</div>

<div class="reveal">
<h2>Purpose of the Program</h2>
<p>The Carpinoy Business Package Accredited Associate Program is intended solely as a business-enabling platform &mdash; a free and optional avenue for individuals who aspire to start or expand a logistics-related enterprise without being burdened by entry fees or employment dependencies.</p>
<p>Carpinoy Logistics Services remains committed to ethical operations, regulatory compliance, and transparent business practices in support of sustainable entrepreneurship.</p>
