  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>2026-01-01</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Carpinoy Logistics</strong> ("we", "us", "our") provides internal automation and tooling (the "Application") for the Carpinoy workspace. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect it.</p>

  <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account/profile:</strong> name and email address obtained via Google identity (openid/email/profile).</li>
    <li><strong>Gmail (read-only):</strong> message metadata and content when the Application reads mail for processing (only with consent and for allowed features).</li>
    <li><strong>Drive files:</strong> file metadata and content needed to perform tasks (when authorized).</li>
    <li><strong>Logs and usage:</strong> operational logs, error reports, and metadata needed to run and secure the Application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Purpose of processing</h2>
  <p>We process the data to provide the Application features: creating and managing Apps Script projects, reading emails for automation, managing Drive content, storing operational state, and supporting administrators. Processing is limited to what is necessary for these purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Sharing and recipients</h2>
  <p>Data is shared only within Carpinoy Logistics or with approved service providers that operate under our instructions (for hosting, backups, or monitoring). We do not publish or sell personal data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data only as long as needed for the Application’s operational purpose, troubleshooting, or legal obligations. Retention periods may vary by data type and legal requirements.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement access controls, encryption in transit, and administrative safeguards to protect data. Only authorized accounts and services have access, and we log administrative actions for audit.</p>

  <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
  <p>As an internal user, you may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data held by the Application. To make a request, contact: <strong>admin@carpinoylogistics.com</strong>.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. The effective date will change when we publish a new version at this URL.</p>
